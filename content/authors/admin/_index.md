Dr. Zhou Xinxin holds a Ph.D. in Cartography and Geographic Information Systems and serves as a master's supervisor in Geomatics Science and Technology at Nanjing Normal University. He is also a part-time advisor at the Graduate Workstation of Guotu Enterprise, an associate director at the Intelligent Integration of Land and Space Production, Education, and Research Base of the China Geographic Information Industry Association. His primary research interests include geographical quantum computing methods, quantum annealing optimization algorithms, geospatial optimization methods, 3D cadastral models, and urban service facility planning.

Dr. Zhou has extensive experience in surveying, geographic information science, and geographic artificial intelligence research and engineering development. He has participated in nine longitudinal research projects and numerous large-scale geographic information engineering developments and technical architectures. Dr. Zhou has been recognized with several awards, including the Top Ten Scientific Advances in Chinese Geography in 2023, the First Prize of the Geographic Information Science and Technology Progress Award from the China Geographic Information Industry Association in 2022, the First Prize of the Jiangsu Provincial Land Society Science and Technology Award in 2022, the Second Prize of the Jiangsu Province Surveying and Mapping Geographic Information Science and Technology Progress Award in 2022, and the Science and Technology Award from the Jiangsu Province Artificial Intelligence Society in 2021.

Dr. Zhou has led various projects, including one National Natural Science Foundation project, one general project from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, one provincial-industry-university project, one project from the Provincial Department of Education, and one open fund from a key laboratory. He has also been a key member in three national-level fund projects. As a technical lead, Dr. Zhou has undertaken five scientific projects for the China Land Survey and Planning Institute and the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Natural Resources.

Dr. Zhou has published over ten academic papers as the first author in renowned journals such as the "Journal of Geomatics", "Chinese Land Science", "Transactions in GIS", "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "Journal of Geographical Systems", and "Survey Review". Additionally, he has applied for numerous invention patents, with five already granted.
